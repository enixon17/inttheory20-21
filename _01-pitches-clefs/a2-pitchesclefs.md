**Why do we need Alto Clef?**

It helps up to not need as many ledger lines. It moves the notes we are looking at up so we are not reading a ton of lines below the treble clef staff.

For you to read Alto and Tenor clef in a useful way, you can't just think of them as note names. Think of the relation in intervals between each clef for better transposing and reading.

**Why do we need both Alto and Tenor Clef?**

There is no reason for Tenor clef. Sadly composers couldn't agree and wrote it for certain instruments that we will have to read parts for.

**Strategies for reading clefs**
- Having anchor notes is helpful. If you use anchor notes, get good at knowing the notes backwards and forwards for ease around the anchor notes you have memorized.
- Practice naming notes in 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths.
- If you use your primary clef as home base, you just need to remember what direction and how far.
- Go through and figure out how each clef is realted to your clef.

### Notes

When written on a staff, a note indicates a pitch and rhythmic value. 
The notation consists of a *notehead* (either empty or filled in), and optionally can include a *stem*, *beam*, *dot*, or *flag*.

### Staff

Notes can't convey their pitch information without being placed on a staff. 
A staff consists of five horizontal lines, evenly spaced. The plural of staff is *staves*.

### Clefs

Notes *still* can't convey their pitch information if the staff doesn't include a clef. 
A clef indicates which pitches are assigned to the lines and spaces on a staff. 
The two most commonly used clefs are the *treble* and *bass* clef; others that you'll see relatively frequently are *alto* and *tenor* clef. 

### Grand staff

The grand staff consists of two staves, one that uses a treble clef, and one that uses a bass clef. 
The staves are connected by a curly brace. 
Grand staves are used frequently for notating piano music and other polyphonic instruments. 

### Ledger lines

When the music's range exceeds what can be written on the staff, extra lines are drawn so that we can still clearly read the pitch. 
These extra lines are called *ledger lines.* 
In the example below, From Haydn's Piano Sonata in G (Hob. XVI: 39), A-flat5 occurs just above the treble staff in the right hand, and G3 and B3 occur just below the treble staff in the left hand.

### Accidentals

Accidentals are used to indicate when a pitch has been raised or lowered. 
They are written to the *left* of the pitch. 

- When you lower one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a flat. 
- When you raise one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a sharp.
- When you raise a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a natural.
- When you lower a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a double flat. 
- When you raise a note that is already sharp by a semitone, you add a double sharp.

The example below shows the symbols for flat, natural, sharp, double sharp, and double flat, respectively.
